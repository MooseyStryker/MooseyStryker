### A little about me

Hello! 

Everything about me comes from my need to learn and be better, I jumped away from my passion of coding and photography into a life of sales. Wow, what the heck was I thinking? Well, I didn't have any communication and social skills. And I realized through my entire school life that people who did the best, tend to be social adept. It's decided then, time to build life skills! This journey led me to becoming the youngest National Team Lead for NERD Power, a position where I took my greatest weakness in to my strength, and taught 17 leaders and over 100 people in the company how to connect and communicate. Whoa, that's a boast in confidence I didn't expect. 

I've found I thrived in environments where I'm uncomfortable and build it to become make those weaknesses and failures, into my strengths. Heck, my nickname "Moosey" comes from this! This nickname comes from a diet journey I decided to go on five years ago, one that led me to a healthier lifestyle and, unexpectedly, to my partner in crime. To say that my change of diet from burgers with cheese, to greens and beans, was a challenge is an understatement. However, it was during this that a colleague dubbed me “cow” and “beef non-patty”. To say this was an irritation is an understatement, I’ve never been that furious before. One day I got annoyed enough that I decided to ask them out, this banter sparked a connection that blossomed into a partnership with the most caring and kind individual I could ever imagine. And has led me to embrace my name, “Moosey”.

Life gives you lemons, but it’s better to call it a gift; and I’ve learned not to settle with lemonade but to aim for lemon cheesecake. My ‘superpower’ isn’t about turning negatives into positives, but to turn them into my strengths. This not-so-secret ingredient has given my life a flavor of resilience and optimism. If there's anything that is 100% me, this is it. This is me in it's most foundational ingredients. Nice to meet you!

Finally, I made the dive into an immersive 8-month program at App Academy, where I put in a grueling 50-80 hours weekly to mastering full-stack development. This rigorous experience threw me into a live work environment, complete with pair programming training and based around project-based learning. It was here that I not only sharpened my technical skills in JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, AWS, Docker, HTML, CSS, and Git, but also pushed my problem-solving mindset and communication skills, which are essential for today’s dynamic tech landscape, to the limit. These founding skills are the base that I built the rest of my software engineering.
